Your friend is going to your city on business. He will stay for a week. Recommend him intersting places.-Hi Chris,I'm very glad that you will have a chance to visit my hometown. There hasn't been a chance for you to do it yet. Wroclaw is a big city and I'm sure, you wan't be disappointed.First of all, I recommend you our sport facilities. As you are keen swimmer, I can refer you our waterpark. It contains several professional swimpools. Additionally, it's a perfect place for relax and fun. With it awesome waterslides of amazing shapes and heights and numerous kinds of saunas you will certainly forget about all your problems and stress after work duties.Secondly, I would advice you to visit our new 5D cinama in Dominican Gallery Shopping Center. The special effects like moving chairs, wind, rain, odours during movie show make that spectator feels like they were inside the place of action. I know that you are a huge fan of horrors, similar as me, and this place often organize marathones of horrors.Next thing worth considering to visit is our famous club "24/7". It's placed in the city's market square. It's hustling and bustling place. With it's DJ, excelent music and delicious cocktails it's the best place to hang out and dance.Lastly but not least, I can recommend you sightseeing of the city itself. Beautiful antigue small streets, enorumous breathtaking churches and town square are must see places. Wroclaw also has it's own skyscraper "Sky Tower". The view from it's top is magnificent.I hope some of my suggestions will proof useful to you. Maybe on one of your free evenings you will find time to stop by my house. I would be delighted to have a chat with you.Take care,Leszek
