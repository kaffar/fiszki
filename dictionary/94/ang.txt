it only serves as a placeholder for the real implementation-zastepczy
Since lambda expressions and functional programming are a cornerstone of Java 8-podstawa
Conversely, if a class marked with the @FunctionalInterface-odwrotnie
and the gist of it is as follows:-istota, esencja, streszczenie
If you’re a bit out of practice with generics, don’t worry.-nie miec praktyki
primate-ssak naczelny
it is possible to reclaim access to the variable age-odzyskac
For the sake of brevity, we sometimes present classes with-dla zwiezlosci
a class is able to maintain certain invariants about its internal data-niezmienniki
An illustrative example may shed some light on this concept.-dobry przyklad moze rzucic troche swiatla na ta koncepcje
In actuality, this is still worlds better than allowing direct-w rzeczywistosci
since the manner in which the name field is accessed has changed-sposob
cuddle tiger-przytulac
and so forth.-i tak dalej
As shown in the preceding code-poprzedni
idea pitch-boisko do pomyslow
We could copy the object before sending it to another method, but this creates a large overhead that duplicates-ociazenie, narzut
Since the state of an immutable object never changes, they are inherently thread safe/inherent-wrodzony, nieodlaczny, tutaj z natury
The second and third rules are straightforward, as they stem from proper encapsulation.-trzon, rdzen, pochodzic
if not specified explicitly-jesli nie wyspecyfikowany jawnie
indicate-wskazaæ
required-wymagany
in compliance with plan-zgodny z planem
developers implement a series of successive changes without considering..-szereg kolejnych zmian
by design-celowo
The current EdenNET architecture has some shortcomings and technical debt that create a lot of problems-niedociagniecia braki i dlug techniczny
The emphasis in EdenNET product development has traditionally been on adding new modules for users at the expense of core improvements, emphasise-nacisk na rozwoj produktu, kosztem podstawowych usprawnien; podkreslac
developers are frustrated with incessant bug reports, and product management is frustrated with irate customers-nieustanne raporty z bugami, podirytowani, wkurwieni
or exhorting developers to write better code-nawolywac
core services (CM, PM, etc.) are scarcely changed since then;scarce, scarcely-rzadki;ledwo
lack of resources and technical oversight services were often coupled to each other-nadzor, kontra; przeoczenie, niedopatrzenie
thus the expedient hack solution was often chosen over the properly designed solution-celowy
Unwieldy and complex modules-nieporeczny
